# JS30 #29: js-countdown-timer
This project builds a custom countdown timer that shows how many minutes and seconds are left in some sort of tasks.
## Overview
* There are different options in the menu where users can click to start the timer. Also, there is an input element next to these options that enables the users to type in minutes they need.
* As one of these options is clicked or minutes are typed in, the timer will begin to count down by showing time left as mins and secs on the page.
* Every time the users choose a new timer option or enter minutes in the input box, the timer will start all over again.
